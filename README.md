## Description.

Api consists of three classes: Register, LogIn and UsersData:

- [Register class](#class-register) is responsible for user registration;
- [LogIn class](#class-login) is responsible for identifying the user in the database's database system;
- [UsersData class](#class-usersdata) is responsible for all the work with files and user directories.

## Getting started.

This API works with Python 2.7

In order to start using the API, you need to download it to your project.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ihgorek/File-Storage-API.git
$ cd File-Storage-API
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
All the necessary libraries for the API are installed.

Api works with the MongoDB database on the local computer.
You need to [install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
to your computer.
After installing the database on your computer and launching it, 
API is ready to work.
